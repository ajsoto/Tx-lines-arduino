## Introduction
This repository provides the code to replicate our results. Our goal was to explain the operation of a transmission line parameter measurement system as a low-cost and automated proposal for its characterization, implemented through embedded systems (Arduino in this case). 

## Usage
The following shows the schematic circuits needed to replicate our experiments (4 in total). For further details, please refer to the paper.
